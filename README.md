            <h2>Project One: Code is the poem</h2>
            <p>Description: "Code is the poem" is a phrase that expresses the beauty and poetic nature I experience during the programming process. As a former graphic designer, I have a keen interest in typography. In this project, I was able to combine the aesthetics of graphic design. I learned to use myFont.textToPoints() to extract the outline points of text from a specified font. I primarily controlled the level of outline detail by adjusting the sampling density, sampleFactor. I also implemented dynamic changes to the text based on mouse movement by calculating offsets. Additionally, I added moving stars with mouse movement to make the scene more lively. I hope to explore more diverse font variations in the future.</p>

            <h2>Project Two: Ecological Resonance</h2>
            <p>Description: My project "Ecological Resonance" emphasizes the interactive relationship between humans and the natural world, showcasing not only the dynamic aesthetics of nature but also revealing the immediate impact of human behavior on the natural environment.
I've created four modes, each representing a type of collective behavior.They are Aqua Swarm, Blossom Breeze, Spore Spread, Photon Dance. I differentiate these ecological scenes through various shapes and colors. As the mouse moves, black pollution appears and spreads, symbolizing human participation and action.I hope to make viewers reflect on the impact of human actions on the natural environment through the contrasting scenes in each display.</p>

            <h2>Project Three: Dynamic Fluidity and Connectivity</h2>
            <p>Description: I believe the key to projects combining Arduino sensors and p5.js lies in the apt integration of physical manipulation with digital creation. Therefore, I connected the teacher taught in the course to the 3D waveform. As fingers approach, diminishing the light, the waveform slows down, as if being flattened. As the fingers move away, increasing the light, the waveform's fluctuations intensify, as if regaining vitality.

I explored the map() function to convert the range of knob inputs into photoresistor signals, specifically for adjusting the stroke weight and movement amplitude of the waveform. I also learned to use for loops and trigonometric functions to calculate the positions of vertices in 3D space to create a spiraling waveform structure.

Through this project, I hope to enable the audience to explore the dynamic interplay between different forms of matter and energy.</p>
